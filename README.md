# badusb
First major project of using "ducky" script and tech 

## What is this?
Personal project utilizing Digispark Attiny85 micro USB to inject scripts into a system. The goal of this project is to experiment with the command line and gain deeper understanding of MS Windows. Currently this project only is for MS Windows, but hopefully will extend to Linux in the future

## DISCLAIMER
This is for experimentation <b>ONLY</b>. These files should never be used on anything but a blank VM or a VM that is designed specifically to be tested with this project. The scripts in this project could potentially be damaging to a personal computer. 

In addition, the scripts in this repository have only been tested with the Digispark Attiny85 Micro USB and have not been tested with other similar "bad usb" technology. If using the Digispark Attiny85 Micro USB, please use an external USB Hub to plug it in, as some people have noticed damage to their USB ports due to poor voltage regulation of the Digispark Attiny85 Micro USBs.
